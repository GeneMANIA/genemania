<p>This version downloads the GeneMANIA data from the staging server (<a href="http://192.168.81.239:9999/data/">http://192.168.81.239:9999/data/</a>)</p>

<p>
GeneMANIA finds other genes that are related to a set of input genes, using a very large set of functional association data. Association data include protein and genetic interactions, pathways, co-expression, co-localization and protein domain similarity. You can use GeneMANIA to find new members of a pathway or complex, find additional genes you may have missed in your screen or find new genes with a specific function, such as protein kinases. Your question is defined by the set of genes you input.
